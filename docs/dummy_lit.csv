Littrup,,2021,,,,,,,"Cryoablation is a well-tolerated outpatient procedure that has been used to treat metastatic sites as well as small breast cancers in patients who are considered poor candidates for surgery. Recent studies suggest that cell disruption caused by cryoablation may increase the expression and immunogenicity of tumor neoantigens, which could enhance the ability of the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells at both local and distant sites. Such an approach might broaden the role of immunotherapy for the treatment of breast cancer, which has previously demonstrated limited response to these agents, likely owing to the modest immunogenicity of most breast cancer subtypes. If cryoablation can induce a systemic tumor-specific response, it could enhance tumor susceptibility to immunotherapy agents. This review briefly summarizes the necessary components for generating an immune response against tumor cells, reviews the tumor microenvironment of breast cancer, describes the rationale for and limitations of immune checkpoint inhibition, highlights the potential for cryoablation to induce a systemic tumor-specific immune response, and describes the rationale for combining cryoablation and immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of breast cancer.

segmentation and classification tasks of breast histopathological images. In
this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the BHIA techniques based
on ANNs. First of all, we categorize the BHIA systems into classical and deep
neural networks for in-depth investigation. Then, the relevant studies based on
BHIA systems are presented. After that, we analyze the existing models to
discover the most suitable algorithms. Finally, publicly accessible datasets,

model that can directly generate IHC-stained images from corresponding
H&E-stained images. We selected and reviewed the five highest-ranking methods
based on their PSNR and SSIM metrics, while also providing overviews of the
corresponding pipelines and implementations. In this paper, we further analyze

Record (EHR) notes that can be useful for biomedical research provided natural
language processing (NLP) methods are available to extract and structure this
information. In this paper, we present a scoping review of existing clinical
NLP literature for cancer. Methods: We identified studies describing an NLP
method to extract specific cancer-related information from EHR sources from
PubMed, Google Scholar, ACL Anthology, and existing reviews. Two exclusion
criteria were used in this study. We excluded articles where the extraction
techniques used were too broad to be represented as frames and also where very
low-level extraction methods were used. 79 articles were included in the final
review. We organized this information according to frame semantic principles to
help identify common areas of overlap and potential gaps. Results: Frames were
created from the reviewed articles pertaining to cancer information such as
cancer diagnosis, tumor description, cancer procedure, breast cancer diagnosis,
prostate cancer diagnosis and pain in prostate cancer patients. These frames
included both a definition as well as specific frame elements (i.e. extractable
attributes). We found that cancer diagnosis was the most common frame among the
reviewed papers (36 out of 79), with recent work focusing on extracting
information related to treatment and breast cancer diagnosis. Conclusion: The
list of common frames described in this paper identifies important
cancer-related information extracted by existing NLP techniques and serves as a
useful resource for future researchers requiring cancer information extracted
from EHR notes. We also argue, due to the heavy duplication of cancer NLP
systems, that a general purpose resource of annotated cancer frames and
corresponding NLP tools would be valuable.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01655v1

Methods: A retrospective cohort of 500 Indian HBOC patients, meeting NCCN criteria who underwent BRCA1/2 testing from 2017 to 2023 were shortlisted for this study. The anonymized data was retrieved from medical records. Genetic analysis was conducted using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) on the Thermo Ion GeneStudio™ S5 System, with positive mutations confirmed via Sanger sequencing. Peripheral blood samples were processed for DNA extraction, library preparation, and variant classification following ACMG guidelines. Results: Out of the 500 patients, 119 (23.8%) were positive for BRCA mutations, and 381 (76.2%) were negative. The prevalence of BRCA pathogenesis, likely pathogenicity, and variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) were 14.8%, 1.6%, and 7.4%, respectively. A total of 128 mutations were detected in the positive BRCA1/2 patients. A statistically significant correlation was found between BRCA mutations with the patient and family history. A total of 38.8% of the patients with mutations had a family history of BC, OC or BC/OC, while 7.6% had other cancers. BRCA mutations were predominant (26.2%) in the age group of 46-65 Y. Among the 128 mutations, 59.3% (76/128) and 40.6% (52/12) of the patients had mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, respectively.

,A Competing Risks Model with Binary Time Varying Covariates for Estimation of Breast Cancer Risks in BRCA1 Families,Yun-Hee Choi; Hae Jung; Saundra Buys,arXiv,2020,,,,,,,"Mammographic screening and prophylactic surgery such as risk-reducing
salpingo oophorectomy (RRSO) can potentially reduce breast cancer risks among
mutation carriers of BRCA families. The evaluation of these interventions is
usually complicated by the fact that their effects on breast cancer may change
over time and by the presence of competing risks. We introduce a correlated
competing risks model to model breast and ovarian cancer risks within BRCA1
families that accounts for time-varying covariates (TVCs). Different parametric
forms for these TVCs are proposed for more flexibility and a correlated gamma
frailty model is specified to account for the correlated competing events. We
also introduced a new ascertainment correction approach that accounts for the
selection of families through probands affected with either breast or ovarian
cancer, or unaffected. Our simulation studies demonstrate the good performances
of our proposed approach in terms of bias and precision of the estimators of
model parameters and cause-specific penetrances over different levels of
familial correlations. We apply our new approach to 498 BRCA1 mutation carrier
families recruited through the Breast Cancer Family Registry. Our results
demonstrate the importance of the functional form of the TVC when assessing the
role of RRSO on breast cancer. In particular, under the best fitting TVC model,
the overall effect of RRSO on breast cancer risk was statistically significant
in women with BRCA1.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05249v2

associated with disease. Thus, investigating the effects of nsSNPs on protein
function will give a greater insight on how nsSNPs can lead into disease.
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women causing highest cancer
death every year. BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumor suppressor genes are two main
candidates of which, mutations in them can increase the risk of developing
breast cancer. For prediction and detection of the cancer one can use
experimental or computational methods, but the experimental method is very
costly and time consuming in comparison with the computational method. The
computer and computational methods have been used for more than 30 years. Here
we try to predict the clinical significance of BRCA1 and BRCA2 nsSNPs as well
as the unknown clinical significances. Nearly 500 BRCA1 and BRCA2 nsSNPs with
known clinical significances retrieved from NCBI database. Based on
hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity and their role in proteins' second structure,
they are divided into 6 groups, each assigned with scores. The data are
prepared in the acceptable form to the automated prediction mechanisms,
Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) and Deep Neural NetworkStacked AutoEncoder

,BRCA Gene Mutations in dbSNP: A Visual Exploration of Genetic Variants,Woowon Jang; Shiwoo Koak; Jiwon Im,arXiv,2023,,,,,,,"BRCA genes, comprising BRCA1 and BRCA2 play indispensable roles in preserving
genomic stability and facilitating DNA repair mechanisms. The presence of
germline mutations in these genes has been associated with increased
susceptibility to various cancers, notably breast and ovarian cancers. Recent
advancements in cost-effective sequencing technologies have revolutionized the
landscape of cancer genomics, leading to a notable rise in the number of
sequenced cancer patient genomes, enabling large-scale computational studies.
In this study, we delve into the BRCA mutations in the dbSNP, housing an
extensive repository of 41,177 and 44,205 genetic mutations for BRCA1 and
BRCA2, respectively. Employing meticulous computational analysis from an
umbrella perspective, our research unveils intriguing findings pertaining to a
number of critical aspects. Namely, we discover that the majority of BRCA
mutations in dbSNP have unknown clinical significance. We find that, although
exon 11 for both genes contains the majority of the mutations and may seem as
if it is a mutation hot spot, upon analyzing mutations per base pair, we find
that all exons exhibit similar levels of mutations. Investigating mutations
within introns, while we observe that the recorded mutations are generally
uniformly distributed, almost all of the pathogenic mutations in introns are
located close to splicing regions (at the beginning or the end). In addition to
the findings mentioned earlier, we have also made other discoveries concerning
mutation types and the level of confidence in observations within the dbSNP
database.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00311v1

,p53 in colorectal cancer: from a master player to a privileged therapy target,Sicheng Yan; Fuyuan Zhan; Yuxuan He; Yuehong Zhu; Zhihong Ma,,2025,,,,,,,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most prevalent malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The pathogenesis of CRC primarily stems from the gradual accumulation of genetic mutations, which drive oncogene (e.g., KRAS) activation and tumor suppressor gene (e.g., TP53) inactivation. Loss of genetic stability facilitates the conversion of proto-oncogenes into active oncogenes and the functional impairment of tumor suppressors, collectively propelling CRC progression. The tumor suppressor protein p53, a transcription factor, induces cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA damage repair under cellular stress, and prevents cancer development by regulating various cellular responses. However, in CRC pathogenesis, TP53 mutations (detected in ~ 74% of cases) subvert these protective mechanisms through dual mechanisms: (i) dominant-negative suppression of wild-type p53 (wt-p53) function, and (ii) acquisition of neomorphic pro-tumorigenic activities, termed gain-of-function (GOF) mutations. New evidence from laboratory and clinical trials shows that some new therapeutic strategies have the potential to treat CRC by reactivating and restoring p53 function, depleting p53 mutants, or targeting p53 with immunotherapy. In this review, we summarize the function of p53 and characterize its mutation in CRC, emphasizing the influence of p53 mutation in the pathogenesis of CRC. In addition, we also describe the current therapeutic strategies for targeting p53 mutants in CRC.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/366c1fd84b915fa1e7d9335c6be5c8ce5ddaee30

cancer biomarker than any other protein. The function of p53 as a nearly
universal tumor suppressor is well established, because of its strong
immunogenicity in terms of not only antibody recruitment, but also stimulation
of autoantibodies. Here we examine bioinformatic fractal scaling analysis for
identifying sensitive epitopes from the p53 amino acid sequence, and show how
it could be used for early cancer detection (ECD). We trim 15mers to 7mers, and
identify specific 7mers from other species that could be more sensitive to
aggressive human cancers, such as liver cancer.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01577v1

,Applying an electrostatic cross-correlation to the CFTR-ATP interaction,Alex Saad-Falcon; Mark Bolding; James Dee,arXiv,2024,,,,,,,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an
important membrane protein in vertebrates. The function of CFTR is to transport
chloride ions across the cell membrane, which is known to require adenosine
triphosphate (ATP). Whereas most conventional wisdom suggests that ATP
interacts with CFTR purely through random collisions via diffusion, we
investigate electrostatic interactions between CFTR and ATP at the mesoscale
(10s of Angstroms). We use molecular dynamics to simulate CFTR-ATP interactions
in cases where CFTR is bound/unbound from ATP, and we demonstrate an
electrostatic potential gradient towards CFTR when ATP is unbound. We
additionally compute electrostatic interactions between ATP and the solvent and
membrane, which are simulated explicitly.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09281v1
,"Bayesian Quantile-Based Joint Modelling of Repeated Measurement and Time-to-Event data, with an Application to Lung Function Decline and Time to Infection in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis",Elisabeth Waldmann; David Taylor-Robinson,arXiv,2016,,,,,,,"Background: The most widely used approach to joint modelling of repeated
measurement and time to event data is to combine a linear Gaussian random
effects model for the repeated measurements with a log-Gaussian frailty model
for the time-to-event outcome, linking the two through some form of correlation
structure between the random effects and the log-frailty. In this approach,
covariates are assumed to affect the mean response profile of the repeated
measurement data. Objectives: Some applications raise substantive questions
that cannot be captured by this structure. For example, an important question
in cystic fibrosis (CF) research is to understand the impact of a patient's
lung function trajectory on their risk of acquiring a variety of infections,
and how this varies at different quantiles of the lung function distribution.
Methods: Motivated by this question, we develop a joint quantile modelling
framework in this paper with an associated Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm
for Bayesian inference. Results: The translation from the common joint model
towards quantile regression succeeds and is applied to CF data from the United
Kingdom. The method helps detecting an overall difference in the relation
between lung function decline and onset of infection in the different
quantiles. Conclusions: Joint modelling without taking into account the special
heteroscedastic structure is not sufficient in certain research question and
the extensions towards models beyond the mean is necessary.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02696v1
,Specialized pro-resolving mediator Resolvin E1 corrects the altered cystic fibrosis nasal epithelium cilia beating dynamics,Valerie Urbach; Maëlle Briottet; Khadeeja Sy,arXiv,2023,,,,,,,"In cystic fibrosis (CF), impaired mucociliary clearance leads to chronic
infection and inflammation. However, cilia beating features in a CF altered
environment, consisting of dehydrated airway surface liquid layer and abnormal
mucus, has not been fully characterized. Furthermore, acute inflammation is
normally followed by an active resolution phase requiring specialized
pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) and allowing return to homeostasis.
However, altered SPMs biosynthesis have been reported in CF. Here, we explored
cilia beating dynamics in CF airways primary cultures and its response to the
SPMs, resolvin E1 (RvE1) and lipoxin B4 (LXB4). Human nasal epithelial cells
(hNECs) from CF and non-CF donors were grown at air-liquid interface. The
ciliary beat frequency, synchronization, orientation, and density were analyzed
from high-speed video-microscopy using multiscale Differential Dynamic
Microscopy algorithm and an in-house developed method. Mucins and ASL layer
height were studied by RT-qPCR and confocal microscopy. Principal component
analysis showed that CF and non-CF hNEC had distinct cilia beating phenotypes,
which was mostly explained by differences in cilia beat organization rather
than frequency. Exposure to RvE1 (10 nM) and to LXB4 (10 nM) restored a non-CF
like cilia beating phenotype. Furthermore, RvE1 increased the airway surface
liquid (ASL) layer height and reduced the mucin MUC5AC thickness. The
calcium-activated chloride channel, TMEM16A was involved in RvE1 effect on
cilia beating, hydration and mucus. Altogether, our results provide evidence
for defective cilia beating in CF airway epithelium and a role of RvE1 and LXB4
to restore the main epithelial functions involved in the mucociliary clearance.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06215v1
,Unveiling the Impact of Social and Environmental Determinants of Health on Lung Function Decline in Cystic Fibrosis through Data Integration using the US Registry,Eleni-Rosalina Andrinopoulou; Emrah Gecili; Rhonda D Szczesniak,arXiv,2025,,,,,,,"Integrating diverse data sources offers a comprehensive view of patient
health and holds potential for improving clinical decision-making. In Cystic
Fibrosis (CF), which is a genetic disorder primarily affecting the lungs,
biomarkers that track lung function decline such as FEV1 serve as important
predictors for assessing disease progression. Prior research has shown that
incorporating social and environmental determinants of health improves
prognostic accuracy. To investigate the lung function decline among individuals
with CF, we integrate data from the U.S. Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient
Registry with social and environmental health information. Our analysis focuses
on the relationship between lung function and the deprivation index, a
composite measure of socioeconomic status.
  We used advanced multivariate mixed-effects models, which allow for the joint
modelling of multiple longitudinal outcomes with flexible functional forms.
This methodology provides an understanding of interrelationships among
outcomes, addressing the complexities of dynamic health data. We examine
whether this relationship varies with patients' exposure duration to
high-deprivation areas, analyzing data across time and within individual US
states. Results show a strong relation between lung function and the area under
the deprivation index curve across all states. These results underscore the
importance of integrating social and environmental determinants of health into
clinical models of disease progression. By accounting for broader contextual
factors, healthcare providers can gain deeper insights into disease
trajectories and design more targeted intervention strategies.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08731v1
,A factor graph EM algorithm for inference of kinetic microstates from patch clamp measurements,Alexander S. Moffett; Guiying Cui; Peter J. Thomas,arXiv,2021,,,,,,,"We derive a factor graph EM (FGEM) algorithm, a technique that permits
combined parameter estimation and statistical inference, to determine hidden
kinetic microstates from patch clamp measurements. Using the cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
(nAChR) as examples, we perform {\em Monte Carlo} simulations to demonstrate
the performance of the algorithm. We show that the performance, measured in
terms of the probability of estimation error, approaches the theoretical
performance limit of maximum {\em a posteriori} estimation. Moreover, the
algorithm provides a reliability score for its estimates, and we demonstrate
that the score can be used to further improve the performance of estimation. We
use the algorithm to estimate hidden kinetic states in lab-obtained CFTR single
channel patch clamp traces.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09594v1
